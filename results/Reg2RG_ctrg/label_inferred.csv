An irregular sheet of high-density shadow is seen at the tip of the upper lobe of the right lung. The surrounding edges are not clear, and flocculent fuzzy shadow and plain stripe focus are seen. Multiple small nodules are seen in both lungs, with a maximum diameter of about 5 mm. No obvious mass or enlarged lymph node is found in mediastinum. No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.","The shape of heart shadow and heart big vessels is normal, and no obvious mass or enlarged lymph node is found in mediastinum. Thorax is symmetrical.
